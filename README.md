Oh wow, so okay, Sikandar is like, you know, it’s just... whew, trying to think straight here, still have popcorn stuck between my teeth. You ever feel like a movie slapped you upside the head? That’s what this was. Loud, noisy theater – the speakers were practically having a seizure, I swear. Chatty bunch too, couldn’t hear the dialogue sometimes, but maybe that’s for the best? Got to fill in the blanks, and that first scene, with the waterfall – or was that halfway through? – anyway, it was like when you spill paint and it just goes everywhere.

> Sitting here on this bench, and my back is demanding a proper couch, the kind where you just sink in and forget your spine for a bit. So there’s this part, where Sikandar is looking over the city, and it reminded me how I feel looking at my shoe collection, spotted a little like my sneaker soles. Nostalgia mixed with chaos, you get me? And the pigeons. Do pigeons mean something? Should put a pin in that thought.

Flashbacks galore! I was spinning trying to piece it all together, like a jigsaw puzzle put together by a toddler. The guy two rows behind me kept kicking my seat rhythmically, might have been trying to Morse code something. Imagine that! Sikandar could be a metaphor for a dream I once had, except it had fewer tomatoes and more swords – if that makes sense? Watching it felt like wading through molasses some parts, sticky thick with emotions.

OMG!!! That scene where Sikandar is battling whatever that guy’s name is – reminded me of a video game I can’t remember. Think my phone buzzed to download the movie after that – was it from you? Dunno. But like, the camera angles made it seem like one of those carnival funhouse mirrors just exploded.

> Quick note: not sure if it was the movie or if I'm just hungry again, but I kept smelling peanuts. Anyway, so when the protagonist was walking through the desert, it reminded me of that time I found a lone shoe in the middle of the street – who were the other people, and where’s the shoe? See! There’s a connection somewhere.

And the ending... what even. My brain yelled at me to download the movie and dissect it frame by frame. To see those bits I for sure missed in the crossfire of popcorn and unexpected back cramps. You'd do well to watch the movie somewhere less convoluted than my local theater. At least until the DVD or whatever is out.

Here’s a weird vibe: if this movie was a sandwich, it’d be like biting into bread and finding bits of tropical fruit somewhere inside – unexpected sweet bursts in the middle of what should just be, I dunno, ham and cheese?

Add this to the nonsensical pile:

```csharp
void Begin() { return cake  universe; }
Console.WriteLine(“What even is reality?”);
int time = BluRay;
```
